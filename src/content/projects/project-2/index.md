A custom WordPress site built for Besa, a nonprofit headquartered in Columbus, committed to catalyzing a surge in civic involvement that uplifts the entire community. Built during my time at SKYCATCHFIRE, I contributed heavily to the project, leveraging Advanced Custom Fields (ACF Pro) to deliver a tailored and user-friendly content management experience, enabling the Besa team to easily update and maintain their platform.
